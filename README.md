# Comp470Group3Project3
 Creating a tool to mine software repositories

paperIssues.csv is where issue data pulled using ghapi is stored \n
Group3Project3.py (could probably be named better) is where Python work is being done \n
DigestableIssuesExample.txt has a nicely formatted look at what type of data is pulled through the API. \n

TODO: Create visualizations using CSV data. Preferably in Python. Thinking we can use a combination of Pandas + Matplotlib
