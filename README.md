# Comp470Group3Project3
 Creating a tool to mine software repositories

paperIssues.csv is where issue data pulled using ghapi is stored

Group3Project3.py (could probably be named better) is where Python work is being done

DigestableIssuesExample.txt has a nicely formatted look at what type of data is pulled through the API.

TODO: Create visualizations using CSV data. Preferably in Python. Thinking we can use a combination of Pandas + Matplotlib
